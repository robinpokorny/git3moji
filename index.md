## Introduction

Prepend one of the five emojis to describe the intention of your commit.

This is
[certainly](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/)
[not](https://github.com/slashsBin/styleguide-git-commit-message)
a new idea. There are many long creative lists of recommended commit emojis. The problem is that “long” and “creative” isn’t good for the real world. Without compliance to some sort of standard with strict limits, emojis are useless in bigger teams. This project aims at providing such a lightweight set.

### Features
* **At the first sight** you can recognise purpose of a commit.
* **Three-letter (or less) codes** are easy to remember and quick to write. No more 📈 (`:chart_with_upwards_trend:`). This is where the `3` in the name comes from.
* **Small set of emojis** prevents time-consuming search for “the best fit”. Every team member can learn them by heart or peak at a credit card-sized cheat sheet.
